# Bitwise Operators Table

| Operation      | Description                                      | Example Usage                      | Result             |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|
| Bitwise AND    | Compares each bit of two numbers, results in 1 if both bits are 1. | `0b1100 & 0b1010` | `0b1000` |
| Bitwise OR     | Compares each bit of two numbers, results in 1 if either bit is 1. | `0b1100 | 0b1010` | `0b1110` |
| Bitwise XOR    | Compares each bit of two numbers, results in 1 if bits are different. | `0b1100 ^ 0b1010` | `0b0110` |
| Bitwise NOT    | Inverts all the bits of the number.             | `~0b1100` (in 4-bit representation) | `0b0011` |
| Left Shift     | Shifts bits to the left, zero-filled.           | `0b0011 << 2` | `0b1100` |
| Right Shift    | Shifts bits to the right, zero-filled (or sign-extended). | `0b1100 >> 2` | `0b0011` |
